  - Enables seamless workflow from Video Notes page to video upload

- **Multi-Video Upload Support**: Upload dialog now supports uploading multiple quality variants of the same video
  - Created `VideoVariantsTable` component to display all uploaded video variants in a compact table format
  - Added "Add Another Quality/Resolution" button to upload the same video in different resolutions (e.g., 1080p, 720p, 480p)
  - Each video variant gets its own `imeta` tag in the published Nostr event
  - Extracted reusable video processing utilities to `lib/video-processing.ts` for handling video metadata extraction
  - Added quality label generation (4K, 1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p) based on video dimensions
  - **Codec Warnings**: Each video shows codec compatibility warnings as dedicated table rows below each video
    - Red alert for AV1/VP9 (not supported on iOS/Safari)

  - Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces: `VideoVariant` for individual videos, updated `UploadInfo` to array-based structure
  - Event creation now generates multiple `imeta` tags with proper dimensions, codecs, bitrate, size, and fallback URLs for each variant
  - Full backward compatibility maintained with single-video uploads

### Fixed

- **Debug Dialog Infinite Checks**: Fixed server availability checks running continuously every second in Debug dialog
  - Root cause: `checkAllAvailability` function was recreated on every state update, triggering infinite useEffect loop
  - Solution: Store function in ref and only trigger check on dialog open transition (false → true)
  - Now checks run only once when dialog opens instead of continuously

### Added

- **Multiple Video Quality Variants Support**: Videos can now have multiple quality variants (e.g., 1080p, 720p, 480p)
  - Enhanced `VideoEvent` data model with `videoVariants` and `thumbnailVariants` arrays
  - Each variant includes URL, SHA256 hash, file size, dimensions, quality label, and fallback URLs
  - Created `VideoVariant` type with comprehensive metadata for each video quality
  - Automatic quality-based fallback: Player tries highest quality first, falls back to lower qualities if unavailable
  - Videos sorted by quality (highest first) for optimal playback experience
  - Supports multiple `imeta` tags in Nostr events for different quality variants
  - Debug Page enhanced with tabbed interface showing Blossom server availability for each variant
    - Separate tabs for each video variant (Video 1, Video 2, etc.) with quality labels
    - Dedicated tab for thumbnail variants
    - Each tab displays server availability, file metadata, and fallback URLs
    - Icons distinguish between video variants and thumbnails
  - Created `useMultiVideoServerAvailability` hook for parallel availability checking across all variants
  - Preserves backward compatibility with single-video events

- **Internationalization (i18n) Support**: Full internationalization implementation with 4 languages
  - Added `react-i18next` for translation management
  - Created comprehensive translation files in `src/i18n/locales/`:
    - `en.json` - English translations (default)
    - `de.json` - German translations
    - `fr.json` - French translations
    - `es.json` - Spanish translations
  - Language switcher added to Settings > General Settings with 4 language options
  - Language preference persisted in localStorage
  - Automatic language detection based on browser settings
  - All user-facing text externalized to translation files including:
    - Navigation menu items (Sidebar, Header)
    - Authentication flows (Login, Signup, Account Switcher)
    - Video components (VideoPage, VideoComments, ShareButton, MirrorVideoDialog)
    - Upload workflow (VideoUpload, FormFields, VideoMetadata, ThumbnailSection, ContentWarning)
    - Settings sections (General, Relays, Blossom Servers, Caching Servers, Cache Management, Missing Videos)
    - All page components (HomePage, ShortsPage, HistoryPage, LikedVideosPage, SearchPage, HashtagPage, AuthorPage, SubscriptionsPage, NotFound)
    - Playlist management (Playlists, CreatePlaylistDialog)
    - Common UI elements (buttons, errors, toasts, empty states)
  - Translation interpolation for dynamic values (counts, dates, usernames, etc.)
  - Organized translation keys by feature/component area for maintainability
  - 500+ translation strings covering the entire application in all 4 languages
  - **Date Localization**: Full date-fns locale support for all languages
    - Relative time formatting (e.g., "2 hours ago", "vor 2 Stunden", "il y a 2 heures", "hace 2 horas")
    - Created centralized `getDateLocale()` utility in `src/lib/date-locale.ts`
    - Supports English (`en`), German (`de`), French (`fr`), and Spanish (`es`)
    - Updated 6 components to use centralized utility: `VideoCard`, `VideoInfoSection`, `VideoComments`, `MissingVideosSection`, `VideoSuggestions`, `ShortsVideoPage`
    - Dates and relative times (e.g., "3 hours ago") now display in the user's selected language

### Fixed

- **HomePage Video Loading on Login**: Fixed videos not loading on HomePage after user login
  - Root cause: When user logs in, their NIP-65 relay list is fetched, changing relays and recreating the loader
  - The reset effect would trigger, but the trigger effect wouldn't run again since loader didn't change a second time
  - This left the page in a loading state with no videos displayed
  - Solution: Modified reset effect to call `next()` after reset completes when loader changes
  - Uses `queueMicrotask` to ensure reset state updates are applied before triggering the load
  - Fixes HomePage and all timeline pages that reload when relays change (e.g., after login, settings changes)

- **AuthorPage Video Loading**: Fixed AuthorPage videos not loading, with skeleton staying visible indefinitely
  - Root cause: Reset effect in `useInfiniteTimeline` triggered on initial mount when loader was first defined
  - The reset would cancel the initial load that was just started by the trigger effect
  - Solution: Changed initial mount check from `if (!loaderRef.current && !loader)` to `if (loaderRef.current === undefined)`
  - Now properly handles both cases: loader undefined or loader defined on first render
  - Only triggers reset when loader changes from a previous non-undefined value
  - Fixes AuthorPage and any other pages where loader is defined immediately on mount

### Changed

- **Mirror Dialog Auto-Recheck**: Mirror Video dialog now automatically rechecks server availability after successful mirroring
  - Added `onMirrorComplete` callback prop to `MirrorVideoDialog`
  - Automatically triggers availability recheck after successful or partial mirror completion
  - Users can immediately see the video is now available on newly mirrored servers
  - Improves UX by confirming mirror operation worked without manual refresh

- **Debug Logging Throttling**: Reduced excessive console logging during video playback
  - `useUserBlossomServers` hook now throttles debug logs to prevent spam
  - Only logs when values actually change (server count, user pubkey) or once every 10 seconds
  - Moved logging to `useEffect` to comply with React's purity requirements
  - Eliminates console spam during video playback while preserving debug information

- **Reaction Buttons UX Improvement**: Enhanced video reaction buttons (upvote/downvote) to prevent duplicate reactions
  - Buttons are now marked with semi-transparent fill (`fill-current/80`) when the current user has already reacted
  - Both buttons are disabled after reacting (either up or down) to prevent changing reactions
  - Icon uses text color with 80% opacity fill when active, maintaining consistent theming
  - Added `useMemo` optimization to efficiently check user's reaction status
  - Applies to both inline layout (VideoPage) and vertical layout (ShortsPage)
  - User can only react once per video with either upvote or downvote

### Added

- **NIP-50 Full-Text Search**: Implemented global video search using NIP-50 protocol
  - Created `SearchPage` component with NIP-50 search filter for full-text search
  - Added `GlobalSearchBar` component in header for easy access to search
  - Created dedicated `useSearchVideos` hook with isolated RelayPool that **only** queries `wss://relay.nostr.band`
  - Search queries all video kinds (21, 22, 34235, 34236) using NIP-50 full-text search
  - Dedicated search pool ensures no other user-configured relays are used for search
  - **Search always uses loader directly**: Events collected from relay subscription in real-time, not from EventStore cache
    - Each search query fetches fresh results from relay instead of reading cached events
    - Events accumulated in local state via `setEvents` for immediate display
    - Events also added to EventStore for caching in other parts of the app
  - Results displayed in responsive video grid with infinite scroll
  - Added `/search` route with query parameter support (`/search?q=query`)
  - Empty state shown when no query provided
  - Document title updates to show search query
  - Comprehensive test coverage with 5 unit tests for SearchPage component

- **Media Caching Servers**: Separated caching/proxy servers from Blossom servers into dedicated configuration
  - Created new `CachingServer` interface (url and name only, no tags)
  - Added `cachingServers` configuration to AppConfig
  - Created new "Media Caching Servers" settings section in Settings page
  - Users can now manage caching servers independently from upload servers
  - Added `presetCachingServers` with default caching server (https://almond.slidestr.net)
  - Updated `generateMediaUrls` to use cachingServers instead of filtering by 'proxy' tag
  - Updated all types in AppContext and global.d.ts to support caching servers
  - Caching servers are used for faster video playback via proxy/caching without upload capabilities

- **Docker Deployment Support**: Added full Docker support with runtime environment configuration
  - Created multi-stage Dockerfile (builder + nginx runtime) optimizing image size (~50MB final)
  - Runtime environment variables injected at container startup (no rebuild needed for config changes)
  - Supports `RUNTIME_RELAYS`, `RUNTIME_BLOSSOM_SERVERS`, `RUNTIME_APP_TITLE`, `RUNTIME_DEBUG`, and `RUNTIME_CUSTOM_CONFIG`
  - Added nginx configuration with SPA routing, gzip compression, security headers, and health check endpoint
  - Created docker-compose.yml for easy deployment with docker-compose
  - Added entrypoint script that generates runtime-env.js exposing `window.__RUNTIME_ENV__` to the app
  - Created public/runtime-env.js fallback for local development (non-Docker)
  - Added comprehensive DOCKER.md documentation with deployment examples (Docker Compose, Kubernetes, CI/CD)
  - Added .dockerignore to optimize build context
  - Added .env.example showing available runtime configuration options
  - Updated README.md with Docker quick start instructions
  - Health check available at `/health` endpoint for container orchestration

- **Watch History Feature**: Implemented video watch history tracking and History page
  - Created `useVideoHistory` hook for tracking video plays in local storage
  - Videos are automatically tracked when loaded in VideoPage and ShortsVideoPage
  - Each history entry stores the full video event and timestamp
  - History is limited to 100 most recent videos (oldest removed first)
  - If the same video is watched again, timestamp updates and moves to front
  - Created new History page (`/history`) to display watch history
  - History page shows videos in a responsive grid layout with most recent first
  - Added "Clear History" button with confirmation dialog
  - Enabled History link in sidebar navigation (previously disabled)
  - History is stored per-device in local storage

- **Mirror Video Dialog Functionality**: Implemented actual Blossom mirror requests in the Mirror Video dialog
  - Users can now mirror videos to additional Blossom servers for improved redundancy and availability
  - Dialog shows currently hosting servers and allows selection of additional servers to mirror to
  - Integrated with existing `mirrorBlobsToServers()` function from blossom-upload.ts
  - Provides detailed feedback: success toast when all mirrors complete, warning toast for partial success with failure count, error toast when all mirrors fail
  - Mirror button is disabled when user is not logged in
  - Uses authenticated Nostr events for mirror authorization via user's signer
  - Automatically checks if files already exist on target servers before mirroring

### Changed

- **VideoPage Player Centering**: Centered video player horizontally in VideoPageLayout
  - Video player now centered horizontally in normal (non-cinema) mode
  - Uses flexbox with items-center for proper alignment
  - Video info section maintains full width below the player
  - Improves visual balance and professional appearance
  - Cinema mode layout remains unchanged

  - Comments sheet in ShortsVideoPage now has a max-width of 2xl (42rem/672px)
  - Centered on desktop for better readability and focused layout
  - Mobile experience remains full-width as expected
  - Improves UX on wide desktop screens

- **Comments Pagination and Collapsible Replies**: Improved comments UX with pagination and expandable replies
  - Top-level comments now show 15 at a time with "Load more" button to show next 15
  - Replies are hidden by default with expandable toggle showing reply count (e.g., "▶ 5 replies")
  - Click to expand/collapse reply threads at any nesting level
  - Prevents overwhelming UI with hundreds of comments loading at once
  - Improves page performance and readability
  - Maintains full threading up to 5 levels deep

- **VideoPage Loading Experience**: Removed video player skeleton to eliminate flickering
  - Skeleton has been completely removed from VideoPage video player area
  - Previous video remains visible when switching videos instead of showing a skeleton
  - Smoother video navigation experience without loading flicker
  - Video info section and sidebar continue to update normally during video transitions

- **Video Poster Loading States**: Added skeleton loading state for video poster thumbnails on VideoPage
  - Both NativeVideoPlayer and HLSVideoPlayer now show a skeleton placeholder while the poster image loads
  - Uses the same pattern as VideoCard thumbnail loading for consistent UX
  - Preloads poster images and tracks loading state to determine when to hide the skeleton
  - Prevents empty/blank video player appearance while poster images are downloading
  - Uses `queueMicrotask` to defer state updates and avoid React's set-state-in-effect warning

- **Thumbnail Loading States**: Added placeholder background while thumbnails are loading
  - VideoCard now shows a skeleton/placeholder background while the thumbnail image loads
  - Provides visual feedback during image loading instead of showing empty space
  - Placeholder automatically disappears once the image has loaded
  - Improves perceived performance and visual polish in video grids

- **Blossom Server Tags**: Removed 'proxy' tag from Blossom server configuration
  - Blossom servers now only support 'mirror' and 'initial upload' tags
  - Proxy/caching functionality moved to dedicated Media Caching Servers section
  - Default blossom server (https://almond.slidestr.net) now has only 'initial upload' tag
  - Improves separation of concerns between upload servers and caching servers

- **Sidebar Menu Cleanup**: Removed "Your clips" menu item from the sidebar
  - Removed disabled "Your clips" item from the Library section
  - Removed unused Scissors icon import from lucide-react

  - Component handles play/pause event listeners, animation timing, and visual transitions
  - Reduces code duplication and improves maintainability
  - Uses same fade-in/fade-out animations with 700ms delay before fade-out
  - Automatically initializes paused state and cleans up event listeners on unmount

- **Blossom Mirror Request Headers**: Modified mirror requests to exclude X-SHA-256 header
  - Implemented custom `customMirrorBlob()` function to replace `BlossomClient.mirrorBlob()`
  - Mirror requests to `/mirror` endpoint now only send `Content-Type` and `Authorization` headers
  - X-SHA-256 header is still sent for upload requests (PUT/PATCH to `/upload`) as required
  - Improves compatibility with Blossom servers that don't require SHA-256 hash for mirror operations

- **Button Component Standardization**: Replaced all standard HTML button elements with shadcn/ui Button components
  - Converted AccountSwitcher to use `<Button variant="outline">` instead of custom-styled `<button>` element
  - Simplified LoginArea Button to use `variant="outline"` prop instead of custom className
  - Added `cursor-pointer` class to all Button components for consistent hover behavior
  - Improved consistency and maintainability across the codebase
  - All interactive elements now use the standardized Button component with proper variants

- **Upload Button Authentication**: Upload button in header now only displays when user is logged in
  - Added conditional rendering based on authentication state using `useCurrentUser` hook
  - Anonymous users no longer see the upload button, reducing confusion
  - Improves UX by showing upload option only when it's actually available

- **Major Package Updates**: Upgraded all packages to latest versions for improved performance and security
  - **React 19**: Upgraded from React 18.3.1 to React 19.2.0 (with react-dom)

  - Added SECURITY_AUDIT_2025-11-17.md documenting full security audit and upgrade analysis
  - No security vulnerabilities found in npm audit
  - All builds and tests verified working after upgrades

### Changed

- **Thumbnail Error Handling**: Improved VideoCard error state when thumbnails fail to load
  - Immediately shows error state if no thumbnail URL is defined in the video event
  - Shows "Thumbnail unavailable" message with broken image icon instead of infinite skeleton loading
  - Tries fallback to video URL thumbnail generation before showing error state
  - Uses muted background with `ImageOff` icon and clear error message
  - Provides better user feedback when thumbnails are missing or fail to load

### Fixed

- **Comment Text Wrapping**: Fixed long comment text and URLs breaking layout
  - Changed `wrap-break-word` (invalid class) to standard Tailwind `break-words` class in VideoComments
  - Added `break-all` class to URL links in RichTextContent to force long URLs to wrap
  - Long URLs and unbreakable text in comments now wrap correctly instead of overflowing
  - Prevents horizontal scrolling caused by very long URLs in comment text

- **Timeline Pages Loading States**: Fixed timeline pages showing empty state flash or stuck in skeleton loading
  - **useInfiniteTimeline fix (HomePage, ShortsPage, HashtagPage)**:
    - Root cause: Previous fix changed `loading = true` initially but forgot to trigger the first load
    - The 24 skeleton cards pushed InfiniteScrollTrigger out of view, preventing automatic trigger
    - Solution: Added `useEffect` to call `next()` when loader becomes available
    - Uses `queueMicrotask` to defer state updates and avoid React's `set-state-in-effect` warning
    - Combines with existing `isFirstLoadRef` mechanism to allow first load when `loading=true`
  - **useTimelineLoader fix (SubscriptionsPage)**:
    - Root cause: Hook initialized with `loading = false`, causing empty state flash before loading effect
    - Solution: Initialize `loading = true` to show skeletons immediately instead of empty state
    - Also set `loading = true` during reload when `reloadDependency` changes for consistent UX
  - All timeline pages now show skeletons during initial load instead of empty state or being stuck

- **Blossom Server URL Double Slashes**: Fixed 404 errors caused by double slashes in Blossom server URLs
  - Updated `normalizeServerUrl()` function to preserve port numbers and remove trailing slashes
  - Added URL normalization at the entry point of all Blossom functions:
    - Upload functions: `customMirrorBlob`, `checkFileExists`, `getUploadCapabilities`, `uploadChunk`, `uploadFileChunked`, `uploadFileToSingleServer`
    - Media URL generation: `generateMirrorUrls`, `generateProxyUrls` (media-url-generator.ts)
    - HEAD request builder: `buildBlossomHeadUrls` (blossom-utils.ts)
    - BlobDescriptor creation: `createMockBlobDescriptor` (blossom-upload.ts)
  - Fixes GET/HEAD/POST/PUT/PATCH requests with double slashes (e.g., `https://server.com//hash` or `https://server.com//upload`)
  - Fixes blob URLs in upload dialog links (target="\_blank") showing double slashes
  - Ensures all server URLs follow format: `protocol://host:port` (no trailing slash, no path)
  - Affects all Blossom operations: uploads, mirrors, blob fetching, size checks, and UI display

- **Infinite Re-render in useUserBlossomServers**: Fixed infinite loop causing performance issues during video playback
  - Root cause: Hook was creating new arrays and objects on every render without memoization
  - Solution: Added `useMemo` to memoize `serverUrls` array and result object
  - Hook now only re-computes when `blossomServers` or `user` actually change
  - Eliminates console spam and performance degradation during video playback

- **Video Loading with naddr URLs**: Fixed VideoPage and ShortsVideoPage to properly load addressable video events (kinds 34235, 34236) via naddr URLs
  - Root cause: Both pages were using `decodeEventPointer()` which only handles nevent/note, returning null for naddr
  - Solution: Updated both pages to use `decodeVideoEventIdentifier()` which handles both nevent and naddr types
  - Added both `eventLoader` and `addressLoader` to handle regular and addressable events respectively
  - For naddr events, uses `eventStore.replaceable(kind, pubkey, identifier)` instead of `eventStore.event(id)`
  - Added regression tests in `lib/nip19.test.ts` verifying decoder functions work correctly
  - Videos with naddr URLs now load correctly instead of showing "Video Not Found" error
  - Also fixed relay extraction in ShortVideoItem component to handle naddr links

- **Addressable Event URL Encoding**: Fixed addressable video events (kinds 34235, 34236) to use `naddr` encoding instead of `nevent`
  - Regular video events (kinds 21, 22) continue to use `nevent` encoding
  - Addressable events now generate NIP-19 `naddr` links with kind+pubkey+identifier for proper addressable reference
  - Added `generateEventLink` helper function in `video-event.ts` to determine correct encoding based on event kind
  - Added test coverage with 3 new tests verifying naddr generation for addressable events
  - Added `decodeVideoEventIdentifier` helper in `lib/nip19.ts` to decode both nevent and naddr identifiers

### Added

  - Updated skeleton text widths to more natural proportions: author (w-2/3), date (w-1/3)
- **Default Relay & Blossom Server Configuration**: New users now start with optimized defaults
  - Added `wss://relay.divine.video` as the primary relay for new users (positioned first in preset list)
  - Added `https://almond.slidestr.net` as default Blossom server with 'proxy' and 'initial upload' tags enabled
  - Applies to first-time visitors, anonymous users, and users logging in for the first time
  - Existing users retain their saved configurations unchanged

### Fixed

- **Timeline Observable Subscription Issue**: Fixed videos not displaying in pages using `useTimelineLoader`
  - Root cause: Observable was being recreated when dependencies like `relays`, `blockedPubkeys`, or `config.blossomServers` changed
  - `eventStore.timeline()` doesn't emit existing events to new subscribers, only emits on new event additions
  - Solution: Separated EventStore subscription from processing logic
    - Use `useObservableState` with default value for stable timeline subscription
    - Only recreate observable when filters change (not when processing dependencies change)
    - Apply `processEvents` transformation in separate `useMemo` that depends on processing parameters
  - Ensures videos remain visible when blocked users list or other config changes

- **Infinite Loop in HomePage and ShortsPage**: Fixed skeleton flashing endlessly
  - Root cause: Loader function was being recreated on every render
  - Each new loader triggered reset in `useInfiniteTimeline`, causing infinite loop
  - Solution: Wrap `videoTypeLoader()` call in `useMemo` with `relays` dependency
  - HomePage, ShortsPage, and AuthorPage now properly memoize their loaders

### Technical Details

- Created `HashtagPage.tsx` component using similar pattern as `SubscriptionsPage`
- Uses Nostr `#t` tag filter for hashtag queries
- Leverages existing `VideoGrid` and `InfiniteScrollTrigger` components
- Implements reactive timeline loading with EventStore and relay subscriptions
- Fixed `useTimelineLoader` by switching from `useObservableMemo` to `useObservableState` pattern
