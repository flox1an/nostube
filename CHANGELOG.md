### Changed

- **Upload Form Wizard**: Redesigned upload form as 4-step wizard with prev/next navigation. Step 1: Video upload with full VideoVariantsTable, Step 2: Form fields (title, description, tags, language), Step 3: Thumbnail selection, Step 4: Additional settings (content warning, expiration). Validation prevents proceeding without required fields (video for step 2, title for step 3, thumbnail for step 4). "Save Draft" button on lower right instead of top "Back to Drafts" button. Required fields marked with asterisk (\*) and each step shows description explaining requirements
- **Upload Hints Removed**: Removed tip text about MP4/H.264 and quick start hint about input method selection from upload wizard for cleaner UI
- **Upload Page Advanced Button**: Opens Blossom dialog instead of navigating to settings
- **Onboarding Separation**: Moved Blossom config from login to upload page

### Changed

- **Draft Deletion UX**: Replaced 5-second undo toast with confirmation dialog offering three options: Cancel, Delete draft only, or Delete draft + media files from Blossom servers. Dialog shows context-aware descriptions based on whether draft contains uploaded media. Includes real-time deletion progress feedback and partial success/failure reporting (DeleteDraftDialog.tsx, DraftPicker.tsx)
- **Draft Picker Layout**: Moved "New Upload" button below draft list, centered with secondary styling for better visual hierarchy
- **Upload Dialog Layout**: Redesigned with responsive two-column layout. Left column (350px) shows video quality summary and thumbnail section. Right column shows form fields (title, description, tags, language, content warning). Single column on mobile (VideoUpload.tsx:343-424)
- **Video Quality Display**: Simplified video quality display with expandable details. Shows quality badges, dimensions, duration, total size, upload/mirror counts, and codec warnings in collapsed state. Click "Show Details" to expand full VideoVariantsTable with all technical details (VideoVariantsSummary.tsx)

### Fixed

- **Duplicate Video Deduplication**: Videos posted as both kind 21 and kind 34235 (or 22 and 34236) with the same `d` tag are now deduplicated in timelines. Prefers addressable events (34235/34236) over regular events (21/22). Same-kind duplicates keep the newer event (video-event.ts:220-268)
- **Draft Upload State Initialization**: Fixed "Add another quality" button not appearing when opening a draft with existing videos. The uploadState now correctly initializes to 'finished' when a draft contains videos, ensuring the additional variant upload UI is visible. Also fixes unnecessary input method selector and URL input showing when videos already exist (useVideoUpload.ts:49-51)
- **Draft Nostr Sync Debouncing**: Fixed draft changes publishing to Nostr on every form field change. Split useVideoUpload's useEffect into two separate hooks: one for form fields (title, description, tags, etc.) that triggers debounced sync (5-second delay), and one for upload milestones (uploadInfo, thumbnailUploadInfo) that triggers immediate sync. Previously, all changes included uploadInfo which triggered immediate sync (useVideoUpload.ts:681-720, useUploadDrafts.ts:244)
- **Draft Generated Thumbnails**: Drafts with generated thumbnails now show video thumbnail in draft list using image proxy
- **Draft Thumbnail Extensions**: Fixed image proxy failing to load thumbnails from Blossom blob URLs without file extensions. Added `ensureFileExtension()` helper that appends appropriate extensions (.jpg, .png, .mp4, etc.) based on MIME types before passing URLs to image proxy (utils.ts:177-205, DraftCard.tsx:23-47)
- **Publish Button**: Now works with generated thumbnails after draft restore
- **Upload Draft Loop**: Fixed infinite re-render in draft persistence
- **Draft Title Persistence**: Draft changes now appear immediately in picker
- **Draft Nostr Sync**: Encrypts and publishes even on quick navigation
- **Draft Deletion Sync**: Deletions now sync to Nostr immediately
- **Dialog Context Errors**: Fixed component hierarchy issues
- **Onboarding Bugs**: Dialog closing, showing for existing users
- **Build Issues**: Vercel deployment, ESLint errors

- **Shorts Performance**: Reduced IntersectionObserver calls 50-70%
- **NSFW Filtering**: Videos with content warnings filtered from suggestions
- **Grid Performance**: Removed console logs, added caching, memoization
- **Embed Player**: Test suite, branding position, nevent encoding
- **Video Loading**: Fixed timeline loading on login, reset logic
- **Blossom URLs**: Normalized to prevent double slashes
- **Infinite Renders**: Fixed in useUserBlossomServers, HomePage, ShortsPage
- **naddr Support**: Video pages now handle both nevent and naddr
- **Addressable Events**: Using naddr encoding for kinds 34235/34236
- **Thumbnail Loading**: Shows placeholder, handles errors
- **Comment Wrapping**: Fixed text overflow issues
- **Pagination Loading**: Fixed skeleton display
- **iOS Autoplay**: Fixed after multiple videos
- **Mobile Sidebar**: Safe area padding
