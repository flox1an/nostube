### Changed

- **Draft Deletion UX**: Replaced 5-second undo toast with confirmation dialog offering three options: Cancel, Delete draft only, or Delete draft + media files from Blossom servers. Dialog shows context-aware descriptions based on whether draft contains uploaded media. Includes real-time deletion progress feedback and partial success/failure reporting (DeleteDraftDialog.tsx, DraftPicker.tsx)
- **Draft Picker Layout**: Moved "New Upload" button below draft list, centered with secondary styling for better visual hierarchy
- **Upload Dialog Layout**: Redesigned with responsive two-column layout. Left column (350px) shows video quality summary and thumbnail section. Right column shows form fields (title, description, tags, language, content warning). Single column on mobile (VideoUpload.tsx:343-424)
- **Video Quality Display**: Simplified video quality display with expandable details. Shows quality badges, dimensions, duration, total size, upload/mirror counts, and codec warnings in collapsed state. Click "Show Details" to expand full VideoVariantsTable with all technical details (VideoVariantsSummary.tsx)

### Fixed

- **Draft Nostr Sync Debouncing**: Fixed draft changes publishing to Nostr on every form field change. Split useVideoUpload's useEffect into two separate hooks: one for form fields (title, description, tags, etc.) that triggers debounced sync, and one for upload milestones (uploadInfo, thumbnailUploadInfo) that triggers immediate sync. Previously, all changes included uploadInfo which triggered immediate sync (useVideoUpload.ts:681-720, useUploadDrafts.ts:232-261)
- **Draft Generated Thumbnails**: Drafts with generated thumbnails now show video thumbnail in draft list using image proxy
- **Draft Thumbnail Extensions**: Fixed image proxy failing to load thumbnails from Blossom blob URLs without file extensions. Added `ensureFileExtension()` helper that appends appropriate extensions (.jpg, .png, .mp4, etc.) based on MIME types before passing URLs to image proxy (utils.ts:177-205, DraftCard.tsx:23-47)
- **Publish Button**: Now works with generated thumbnails after draft restore
- **Upload Draft Loop**: Fixed infinite re-render in draft persistence
